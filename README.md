# Clone Alpha pas Clone Soja

Deadline: May 8th.

## Objective

Develop a tool that:
- Clones a directory D to D' (firstly on demand, and secondly automatically), then
- Synchronizes the two directories - i.e. if the content of D or D' changes then the other one is updated.
- Integrate an extra functionality that makes the tool more "interesting" than the others.

## Constraints

- The tool must be usable (and robust)
- The tool must be documented: a) user manual, b) code structure, and c) extra functionality overview.
- The source code and the documentation must be available in the jar

## Extra constraints

- The directories D/D' can be in separate computers (network part)
- The tool must have a control interface (graphical user interface)
